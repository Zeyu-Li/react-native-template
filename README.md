# React Native Template

A React Native app created with

```shell
react-native init template
```



## Debugging

You have two options for developing a React Native app with Android. You can use a emulator or a physical device to test



First I will show how to create an Android emulations with Android Studio (this is not the only option and you may chose another Android emulator)

To do that, you can follow this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DhQd_EK1Ng



The second and better option is to use a physical device as it will reflect a closer state to the real deployment of React Native
